Purpose
*******

*picme* contains programs to estimate and plot phylogenetic informativeness for
large datasets.


Citing picme
************

When using picme, please cite:

- Faircloth BC, Chang J, Alfaro ME: *picme* enables high throughput analysis of
  phylogenetic informativeness.

- Townsend JP: Profiling phylogenetic informativeness. Systematic Biol. 2007,
  56:222-231.

- Pond SLK, Frost SDW, Muse SV: HyPhy: hypothesis testing using phylogenies.
  Bioinformatics 2005, 21:676-679.

Dependencies
************

- hyphy2 (please `download <https://github.com/faircloth-lab/picme/downloads>`_ or build a **single-threaded** hyphy2)
- Python 2.6
- numpy
- scipy
- dendropy

Installation
************
For the moment, the easiest way to install the program is::

    git clone git://github.com/faircloth-lab/picme.git /path/to/picme

To run tests::

    cd /path/to/picme/
    python test/test_townsend_code.py

Use
***

The `estimate_p_i.py` code calls a batch file for hyphy that is in
`templates/`.  This file needs to be in the same position relative to
wherever you put `estimate_p_i.py`.  If you install thins as above, you'll
be fine, for the moment.

To run::

    cd /path/to/picme/

    python picme_compute.py Input_Folder_of_Nexus_Files/ Input.tree \
        --output Output_Directory \
        --epochs=32-42,88-98,95-105,164-174 \
        --times=37,93,100,170 \
        --multiprocessing

`--multiprocessing` is optional, without it, each locus will be run
consecutively.

If you have already run the above and saved results to your output
folder (see below), you can use the pre-existing site-rate records
rather than estimating those again with::

     python picme_compute.py Input_Folder_of_Site_Rate_JSON_Files/ Input.tree \
        --output Output_Directory \
        --epochs=32-42,88-98,95-105,164-174 \
        --times=37,93,100,170 \
        --multiprocessing \
        --site-rates

Results
*******

picme writes results to a [sqlite](http://www.sqlite.org/) database in the
output directory of your choosing.  This directory also holds site rate
files in [JSON](http://www.json.org/) format for each locus passed
through `picme_compute.py`.

You can access the results in the database as follows.  For more examples,
including plotting, see the 
`documentation <http://faircloth-lab.github.com/picme/>`_

- crank up sqlite::

    sqlite3  Output_Directory/phylogenetic-informativeness.sqlite

- get integral data for all epochs::

    select locus, interval, pi from loci, interval where loci.id = interval.id

- get integral data for a specific epoch::

    select locus, interval, pi from loci, interval 
    where interval = '95-105' and loci.id = interval.id;

- get the count of loci having max(PI) at different epochs::

    create temporary table max as select id, max(pi) as max from interval group by id;

    create temporary table t as select interval.id, interval, max from interval, max 
    where interval.pi = max.max;

    select interval, count(*) from t group by interval;
